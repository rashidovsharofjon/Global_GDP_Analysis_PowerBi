# Global_GDP_Analysis_PowerBi
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Global GDP (2000â€“2024). The project involved cleaning and transforming the dataset (unpivoting and filtering), creating visualizations (line charts, filled maps, tables, cards, slicer), and examining trends across countries, regions, income groups, and global aggregates.
